//You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. Return the number of substrings in s that begin and end with the same character.
//
//A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
//
//        Example 1:
//
//Input: s = "abcba"
//Output: 7
//Explanation:
//The substrings of length 1 that start and end with the same letter are: "a", "b", "c", "b", and "a".
//The substring of length 3 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "bcb".
//The substring of length 5 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "abcba".
//Example 2:
//
//Input: s = "abacad"
//Output: 9
//Explanation:
//The substrings of length 1 that start and end with the same letter are: "a", "b", "a", "c", "a", and "d".
//The substrings of length 3 that start and end with the same letter are: "aba" and "aca".
//The substring of length 5 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "abaca".
//
//Example 3:
//
//Input: s = "a"
//Output: 1
//Explanation:
//The substring of length 1 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "a".
